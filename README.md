# Accountability data cleaning
A collection of scripts and processing notes used for the public accountability project. 

Each directory generally corresponds to a dataset, except that nonprofits contains 1023EZ export in [one subdirectory](https://github.com/irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning/tree/master/nonprofits/1023EZ) and [queries](https://github.com/irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning/tree/master/nonprofits/nonprofit_queries) for dumping employee and grant information in another. 

Many of the files used in the project are obtained and handled elsewhere; this only describes a subset where code was used for transformations / processing.
