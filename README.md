# Accountability data cleaning
A collection of scripts and processing notes used for the public accountability project. 

Most state-by-state files are within the R_Tap or SQL_TAP directories. Other directories are for national data sets. The Voters folder containings documentation for state-by-state voter files processed both in R and SQL.

Many of the files used in the project are obtained and handled elsewhere; this only describes a subset where code was used for exploring and cleaning data. 

The nonprofits contains 1023EZ export in [one subdirectory](https://github.com/irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning/tree/master/nonprofits/1023EZ) and [queries](https://github.com/irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning/tree/master/nonprofits/nonprofit_queries) for dumping employee and grant information in another.
