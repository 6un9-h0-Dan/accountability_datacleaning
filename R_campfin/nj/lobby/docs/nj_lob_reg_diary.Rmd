## Project

The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and give journalists, policy
professionals, activists, and the public at large a simple way to search across huge volumes of
public data about people and organizations.

Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking of each dataset row as a
transaction. For each transaction there should be (at least) 3 variables:

1. All **parties** to a transaction
2. The **date** of the transaction
3. The **amount** of money involved

## Objectives

This document describes the process used to complete the following objectives:

1. How many records are in the database?
1. Check for duplicates
1. Check ranges
1. Is there anything blank or missing?
1. Check for consistency issues
1. Create a five-digit ZIP Code called `ZIP5`
1. Create a `YEAR` field from the transaction date
1. Make sure there is data on both parties to a transaction

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize, analyze, and communicate
these results. The `pacman` package will facilitate their installation and attachment.

The IRW's `campfin` package will also have to be installed from GitHub. This package contains
functions custom made to help facilitate the processing of campaign finance data.

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, dfrning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("irworkshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  httr, # interact with http responses
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # dataframe clean
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  scales, # format strings
  knitr, # knit documents
  vroom, # read files fast
  glue, # combine strings
  here, # relative storage
  fs # search storage 
)
```

This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which lives as a sub-directory of
the more general, language-agnostic [`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`][01] GitHub
repository.

The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio projects][02] feature and should be run as such. The
project also uses the dynamic `here::here()` tool for file paths relative to _your_ machine.

```{r where_here}
# where does this document knit?
here::here()
```

## Data

Lobbyist data is obtained from the [New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission][03].

> #### Download
> "View Quarterly Reports and Quarterly Summary" -> "Entity Search" -> "Search" -> "Download Records"

The [Entity Search page][04], we can see a table is generated and can be retrieved:

The data is downloaded on March 11, 2020.


First, we must download a reporting linking lobbyists to their principals.

```{r raw_dir}
raw_dir <- dir_create(here("nj", "lobby", "data", "raw", "reg"))
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
# not working
njlr <- read_csv(dir_ls(raw_dir))
```

Then, we can see that the date columns are all read as text, and we'll convert them back to date objects with `as.Date`.

```{r convert date}
njlr <- njlr %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with("date")), as.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```


## Import

Using these three files, we can create a single data frame listing lobbyists and those for whom
they lobby.

```{r read_lobs}
lobs <- 
  # read as string
  read_lines(file = in_raw("sc_lobs.csv")) %>%
  extract(-2) %>% 
  # fix quote enclosure
  str_replace("\"Eye\"", "'Eye'") %>%
  # pass as delim file
  read_delim(
    delim = ",",
    escape_backslash = FALSE,
    escape_double = FALSE,
    na = c("", " ")
  ) %>%
  # clean shape
  remove_empty("cols") %>% 
  clean_names("snake")

# clarify col names
names(lobs) <- names(lobs) %>% 
  str_remove("_(.*)") %>% 
  str_remove("code$") %>% 
  str_c("lob", ., sep = "_")
```

```{r read_pris}
pris <- 
  read_delim(
    file = in_raw("sc_pris.csv"),
    delim = ",",
    escape_backslash = FALSE,
    escape_double = FALSE,
    na = c("", " ")
  ) %>% 
  remove_empty("cols") %>% 
  clean_names("snake")

names(pris) <- names(pris) %>% 
  str_remove("_(.*)") %>% 
  str_remove("code$") %>%
  str_replace("^lpname$", "name") %>% 
  str_c("pri", ., sep = "_")
```

```{r read_xref}
xref <- read_delim(
    file = in_raw("sc_xref.csv"),
    delim = ",",
    escape_backslash = FALSE,
    escape_double = FALSE,
    col_types = cols(.default = "c"),
    na = c("", " ")
  ) %>% 
  remove_empty("cols") %>% 
  clean_names("snake") %>% 
  rename(
    lob_last = lastname,
    lob_first = firstname,
    lob_address = address,
    lob_city = city,
    lob_state = state,
    lob_zip = zipcode,
    lob_phone = phone,
    pri_name = principal_name,
    lob_mi = middle_init,
    lob_suffix = suffix
    )
```

```{r join_xref}
sclr <- xref %>% 
  left_join(pris, by = "pri_name") %>% 
  select(
    starts_with("lob"), 
    starts_with("pri")
  )
```

```{r}
prop_in(
  x = str_normal(paste(lobs$lob_first, lobs$lob_last)),
  y = str_normal(paste(xref$lob_first, xref$lob_last)),
)
```
